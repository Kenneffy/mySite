			<h2>Hi there!</h2>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I'm Sphen and some of my favorite things to do are reading, cooking & creating funky designs. I'm a freelance web developer who is quite involved with technology as well as education.</p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>	
			<p>I come from a marketing background and have taken various roles in analytics, operations & consulting. I look for opportunities that are people focused and impactful to society. One of my biggest beliefs is that anyone can learn anything if they put in the heart and dedication to their goal.</p>
